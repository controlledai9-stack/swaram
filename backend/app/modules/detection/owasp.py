"""SwarmGuard coverage of the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (OWASP GenAI Security Project, Dec 2025).

Each risk lists the detection rules that cover it, the controls that act on it (enforcement, not just alerts), and
what is honestly still missing. `coverage` is our own judgement: "strong" = detected and enforced with tests,
"partial" = detected or enforced only in part. GET /api/coverage/owasp serves this; docs/owasp-agentic.md explains it.
